## Research Experience
- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks**
School of Computing, University of Utah    
(Oct., 2018 - Presentï¼‰
Advisor: Prof. Shandian Zhe
> * Primary Framework: Tensorflow
> * Applied Bayesian Optimization, Genetic Algorithm, Hyperband and Random Search Algorithms to hyper-parameters optimization (width and depth) of Physics-Informed Neural Networks, a data-driven solution of nonlinear PDE (Partial Differential Equations), including Burgers and Poisson PDE.
> * Used matplotlib to show the results of each algorithms on each PDE, where the best result (error rate) of Burgers is 3.3e-4 and that of Poisson is 0.7e-4. 
> * Analysed the sampling error of Physics-Informed Neural Networks of Burgers and Poisson PDE.
[Here](Burgers_and_Poisson_10.pdf) are some figures of results.


- **Automation of Multifactor Models Construction**
IIIS, Tsinghua University     
(Jun. - Oct., 2018)
Advisor: Prof. Jian Li
> * Primary Framework: Pytorch
> * Independently investigated DART (Differentiable Architecture Search) and its implementation.
> * Divided the recent stock data (including factor data and price data), into training set and verification set.
> * Proposed a MFC (Mutable Fully Connected) layer based on the idea of AutoML to automatically select multifactor operations by setting a threshold and finally achieved explicable multifactor (Alpha) formulas.
> * Published a paper (only author) From conventional Machine Learning to AutoML accepted by International Conference on Control Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (CCEAI 2019).
