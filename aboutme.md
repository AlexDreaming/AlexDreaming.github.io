### <i class="fa fa-gittip"></i> Hobbies

- **Bodybuilding**: *Life lies in movement.* Past three years' training has changed me from Mr.Fatty to Mr.Muscle. Currently,my BF% is 8.2% where my wieght is 68 Kg. My current trend is to tone up: be muscular and healthy.

- **Travel**：*The world is a book, but people do not travel read only one page.* I've seen many beautiful places (Los Angeles,Salt Lake City,Paris,Switzerland,Rome,Venice...) and that gives me a chance to see how other people live, appreciate what I have and learn how to be a better story-teller.

- **Moive**: *I am a leaf on the wind. Watch how I soar.* I always enjoy science fiction and action movies. My favorite movie stars are Jackie Chan and Jason Statham. What about you?
